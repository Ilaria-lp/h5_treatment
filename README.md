Double click on the program and wait for it to run. New files will be saved in a subfolder.
If you prefer, you can launch them from the terminal and follow the progress of the analysis.

  fixes incomplete data collection (due to beam dumps or manual interruption) and makes a new file discarding the non-valid pixels

reshape_XRF-MAPS
  creates new files reshaping the maps so that you do not need to input rows and columns in ROI imaging
